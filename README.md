# Issue

* Password masking does not work on Eclipse/Intellij (must run manually in CMD)
* English is supported by default. Korean(Hangul) may cause problems.
* The representation of Unicode in CMD(or PowerShell) is different in Windows7 and Windows10. (In case of Windows7, Replace 'â”€' to '-' in TableList.class)
* For readability, it may be helpful to run DevTools after settings the text color to White.<br>
In case of windows CMD, Enter this command.
```
Color F
```
