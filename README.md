# Setup

Download Mysql Connector from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ 

Include mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar in your project class path (Add CLASSPATH variable as your environment variable for running with cmd)

Compile source code and run (packaging must be done if compiled using javac - include the src directory in your CLASSPATH)


#Issue

Password masking does not work on Eclipse (must run with javac)
